# CampusMap

CampusMap is a console app that helps the user navigate UIC's campus. The project uses Dijkstraâ€™s algorithm to find the shortest weighted path from a given starting location to a given ending location. This project is based on [OpenStreetMap](https://www.openstreetmap.org/) to navigate through the UIC campus, and uses [TinyXML](http://www.grinninglizard.com/tinyxml/) to parse the `.xml` files.
